Leverage by Rob Moore</h3>\n<p>Read this book today and yesterday. Some part of it was definitely worth it.</p>\n<p>My summary of the book:</p>\n<p>Ways to create high leverage with following tactics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use Paretto's rule as a heuristic to always focus on something whether it be task managing, studying, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I always knew this rule existed but never thought it as a rule of thumb to create leverage. Might create huge impact on how I make decisions daily.</li>\n<li>But on the other hand, I also always felt that Paretto's rule is only correct on certain scnearios and never explains causaility of something. Kind of a double edged sword.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spend time on compounding activities. - Accumulating knowledge, building experties, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This I kind of knew but was slept on.</li>\n<li>For my situation this advice can be translated into:\n<ul>\n<li>don't spend time too much on building softwares that only feed you in short term.</li>\n<li>spend more time on building deeper tech stuff (in-house project or open source) + study a lot.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Listen to audio books - auth repeatedly mentioned this as one of his beloved habits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Might try this next week.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get a mentor</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I already watch a lot of youtube &#x26; read books.</li>\n<li>However, I really need irl coach or mentor.</li>\n<li>My company doesn't have any successfuly software engineers.</li>\n<li>I need to spend more time on finding one outside</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the book was not really organized. Details were not logically ordered and same details were repeated on many chapters.</p>\n<p>Where it was not organized and induced frustration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explains about three stages of controlling emotions - directives were vague. - I assumed that chapter was not well thought-out by the author.</li>\n<li>I believe the book can be shrunken to about 20 pages. Same advices were repeatedly given after halfway through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Writing Scenarios Before Deploying</h3>\n<p>Getting Slack alerts about fatal errors on holidays is frustrating.</p>\n<p>Today and yesterday, I received a ton of Slack alerts. It was caused by a simple bug. On Friday, We deployed without thoroughly testing it.</p>\n<p>I feel like there are better ways to handle this—maybe write end-to-end hand-test scenarios somewhere and \"check off\" whether you've done the relevant new tests before deploying?</p>\n<h3>3. Dopamine-Driven Development</h3>\n<p>Saw a video on youtube that having a nice terminal + a great setup makes you feel happier at work.</p>\n<p>It made sense. I used to think there shouldn’t be too much effort spent on prettifying the work UX, but I’ve changed my mind.</p>\n<p>Some Action Plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade my terminal's UI UX</li>\n<li>Change my keyboard at home</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. GPT Life Consulting</h3>\n<p>I prompoted this in korean: \"Tell me the biggest things I'm missing in my life right now. Ask me a lot of questions—maybe more than 20?\"</p>\n<p>Then I answered questions the llm asked, then got a lot of advice about my life.</p>\n<p>Action Plans I got:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Monitor my growth and review weekly. Did I grow with current schedule of work at my company?\n<ul>\n<li>I think this can be done by looking at TILs I'm writing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Practice habits to grow strong mentality. - I got a recommended list of effective habits.\n<ul>\n<li>Might gradually implement all of them. Let's start with \"Mindfulness Meditation\" every single day. Now I will add checkbox on the top of TIL.</li>\n<li>Maybe add one habit per week?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Actively find outside mentors\n<ul>\n<li>join communities - r/ExperiencedDevs, bootcamps, social events</li>\n<li>side projects - open source contribution</li>\n<li>read tech articles regularly</li>\n<li>tech talk, conferences</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>1, 2, 3 can all be tracked with TIL.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 07, 2025","slug":"/til/2025-06-07","title":"2025 06 07","subtitle":"Logging what I learned daily"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"baa813e6-e260-54ff-8368-e4680b30b1b2","frontmatter__slug":"/til/2025-06-07","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"til"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1865044719","2228436175","326441978"],"slicesMap":{}}
