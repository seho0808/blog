The most important bits I learned:\n<ul>\n<li>always solve the weakest assumption first - selling feasibility, building feasibility, etc.</li>\n<li>Prototypes and Products should be differentiated. Prototypes usually take from 2 hours to a few days. MV-Products usually take from 2 days to 90 days.</li>\n<li>MV-Product should include a full piece of the pie: functioanl, reliable, usable, emotional design (the full mvp pyramid)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It seems very obvious but was elusive when I was actually doing the job. It was probably because:\n<ul>\n<li>We, in nature, tend to close our eyes and run to build since we hate to face our ideas fall to ground.</li>\n<li>It feels bothersome and stressful to create some mock product and to do interviews and surveys.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>So basically, we should do PAINFUL THINGS to success. And looking back, I think my team could have done a lot better in many cases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After I thoroughly finish all the books, I should share my thoughts to my teammates...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LLM &#x26; Agent Trend Ebook</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I initiated a program for a couple of engineers (6 currently, including me) to write a book about LLM &#x26; Agent Tools Trends.</li>\n<li>This is a side project to study + make profit out of.</li>\n<li>Just built a landing page, and trying to see how people react to this.</li>\n<li>Will try to sell even before starting the first chapter of the book.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 07, 2025","slug":"/til/2025-10-07","title":"2025 10 07","subtitle":"Logging what I learned daily"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6616a47b-0cb2-58ef-bce6-caeda994e344","frontmatter__slug":"/til/2025-10-07","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"til"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1865044719","2228436175","326441978"],"slicesMap":{}}
