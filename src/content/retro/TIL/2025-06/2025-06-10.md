### Colliding thoughts on testing

We have 70% integration tests for our CRUD heavy app.
It's now taking over 5 minutes to run npx jest since it cannot be parallelized unless we run multiple docker db containers.
I mean we could do that and will do that, but even so, eventually that will also hit a wall at some point.
So should be go more Unit? or stay more on integration?

I feel like it is pretty hard to decide at this point.

First thing I am considering is refactoring original code to be more testable.

After that I will consider moving some of integration test heavy features into unit test heavy way.
