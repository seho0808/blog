## 06-12

### OKR

We used the entire day setting company OKR. It was very challenging.

We debated on what each of us define OKR was for 3 hours and then used another 2 hours to jot down + vote for the best Objectives we came up with.

The voting part was more of a voice of each individuals and not an absolute decision to be made as the company's Objectives.

I believe in my CEOs so they come to a agreeable Objectives over the weekend.

We will setup KRs next week or possibly challenge the final Objectives that c-levels came up with.
