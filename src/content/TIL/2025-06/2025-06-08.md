## 06-08

### 1. Rabbit MQ

- schemed throughy the amqp spec (about 40 pages) - only organized section 2 on my [blog post](/blog/amqp-spec)
- went through the RabbitMQ tutorial on its official website

While peer reviewing rabbit mq connection test code, I found that either channel or connection exception results in an amqp connection close.
It was also mentioned in 2.3.6 of error handling of amqp spec.
